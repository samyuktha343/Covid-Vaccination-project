## Contents

1. *Data Collection*
   - Obtain COVID-19 vaccination data from reliable sources, such as government health agencies or global health organizations.My dataset is from Kaggle.com.Dataset link:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/covid-vaccinations-2023) 

2. *Data Preprocessing*
   - Clean and format the raw data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   - Handle missing values and outliers appropriately.

3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
   - Identify patterns, correlations, and potential areas for further investigation.

4. *Data Visualization*
   - Create informative visualizations using tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
   - Present vaccination trends, distribution, and coverage.
.
Run the Code:

Execute the main script to analyze the covid vaccination data.

python covid project.py
The script will perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and generate insights.

View Results:

The results and visualizations will be saved in the output folder. You can explore them to gain insights into covid vaccination  data.
